# platform-test-nextjs

> **⚠️ This repository is archived.**
>
> The Next.js application has been migrated to the [platform-test](https://github.com/navapbc/platform-test) repository as `app-nextjs`. All future development and updates will occur in that repository.
>
> This consolidation allows us to test multiple applications within a single infrastructure setup, better reflecting real-world platform usage.
